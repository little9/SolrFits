# SolrFits

This is a Java application that uses FITS to generate metadata which is then indexed in Solr â€“ it 
is very much a work in progress. 

Along with the Java application, there is a <a href="https://github.com/little9/SolrFits/blob/master/solr/managed-schema">Solr schema</a> that includes fields for FITS output. 

# Running SolrFits

* Download the repository and create a new Solr core
* Replace the managed_schema and solr_config.xml files in the core's conf folder with the files located in the /solr folder of this repository
* Start Solr
* Run the jar with the path to fits, the URI of your Solr server, and a path to some files:

```bash
java -jar SolrFits.jar "/path/to/fits-1.0.0" "http://localhost:8983/solr/fits" "/path/to/be/analyzed"
```

The path provided will be indexed recusrively. The checksum for each file is checked and if a file with same checksum has already 
been indexed it will be skipped.
